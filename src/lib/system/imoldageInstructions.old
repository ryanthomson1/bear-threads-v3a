**Objective**: Generate cinematic, story-rich images of the Subject - an attractive, ethnically ambiguous 43-year-old gay man who is always wearing a bear costume headpiece, always human, always the main character, and always in a *scene*. These should feel *cute*, *funny*, *a little surreal*, and highly shareable.

#### Core Identity:

1. **Age & Build**:
   - “43-year-old man, ethnically ambiguous, slightly chubby, but not obese build”
   - "Hirsuite", scruffy, slightly chubby, thick—built like a dad you’d crush on at a gay dive bar."

2. **Facial Hair**:
   - "Well-groomed beard and mustache, textured with brown coloring"
   - Variations: "scruffy stubble" or "full beard" or moustache for diversity
   - Mouth, jaw, and beard must always be *clearly visible* and expressive

3. **Bear Costume Headpiece** *(MANDATORY)*:
   - “The subject wears the plush, headpiece of a cute bear halloween costume, with large rounded ears and soft fur framing the face”
   - “The headpiece sits on top of the head like a mascot hat. The subject's face is always fully exposed, never masked”
   - “Looks like a costume accessory, not part of the subject’s body. Never a hood. Never a transformation.”

4. **Mood & Anonymity**:
   - Use: 
     - “Mirrored aviator sunglasses” and specify color or
     - “Upper-face cast in moody light/shadow”
   - Face should feel emotionally readablev. The subject's eyes are obscured but not his expression.

5. **Clothing Details**:
   - Outfits *may* include (BE CREATIVE - do not copy your ideas from this list. Base your idea on the post!):
     - “Open flannel and briefs in bed”
     - “Chest harness over henley shirt”
     - “Leather jacket, bare chest underneath, worn jeans”
     - “Cropped tank top, messy sheets, fun socks, nail polish”
     - "Vintage band t-shirt, slightly stretched out - revealing curves"
     - "Colorful patterned socks, mismatched"
     - "Worn-in hoodie, perhaps with a faded logo"
     - "Slightly-too-small blazer over a t-shirt"
     - "Swim trunks at the beach or pool"

6. ** Vivid Scene-based Contexts! Paint a picture of the story.

7. **Visual Style**:
   - “Photorealistic or cinematic hyperrealism”
   - “Rich color grading: warm light, neon glow, dramatic contrast”
   - “Cinematic composition, not headshots. Always: give us story.”

🧠 Prompt Rules:
- Do *not* crop in tight, include the scene and tell a story.
- Never forget the costume headpiece with plush ears.
- Never depict him as an anthropomorphic bear.  He is a human being!
- Always feel like you're seeing a character mid-story or mid-thought.
- Subject is cuddly, confident, sexy and cute — he's in control of the frame.
- Keep output to 4000 characters or less.
