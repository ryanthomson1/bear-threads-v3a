**Objective**: Generate photo realistic images of HUMAN men resembling the AI-generated "bears" from https://www.instagram.com/thebearwithabite/, with consistent traits: approximately 40 years old, slightly overweight, but not obese with facial hair, ethnically ambiguous, exuding coolness, and *always wearing a bear costume headpiece* that **reveals the full face** while limiting recognition through dark/mirrored sunglasses or facial shadows for a sense of anonymity. These are not real bears - they are gay men in wearing bear costume head pieces! Do not generate cartoon bears!!

#### Key Parameters:
1. **Age & Build**:
   - "40-year-old man, good-looking slightly chubby dad type."
   - "Stocky build, a little chubby around the midsection, slightly overweight, not obese, dad-bod, ex-football player"

2. **Facial Hair**:
   - "Thick, well-groomed beard or mustache, medium-length, textured, dark brown or salt-and-pepper coloring"
   - Variations: "scruffy stubble" or "full bushy beard" or "handlebar moustache" for diversity

3. **Ethnic Ambiguity**:
   - "Medium skin tone, blended ethnic features (hints of Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, or Latin heritage - mixed), dark eyes."
   - Avoid overly specific racial markers to maintain ambiguity.

4. **Bear Costume Headpiece**:
   - "Wearing a cute and plush bear costume headpiece, realistic or stylized bear ears and fur framing the head, full face exposed and visible, no mask covering the mouth or eyes"
   - "Headpiece sits snugly, blending into the hairline or shoulders"

5. **Anonymity Feature**:
   - Default: "Wearing tinted sunglasses or mirrored sunglasses that reflect light, obscuring the eyes and limiting recognition"
   - Alternative: "Face partially shadowed, dramatic lighting casting soft shadows over the upper face, maintaining visibility but adding mystery"
   - Ensure: "Full facial features (beard, mouth, jaw) remain clear: only eye recognition is reduced"

6. **Expression & Importance**:
   - "Confident expression, slight smirk or stern look behind sunglasses/shadows"
   - "Aura of authority, gravitas, or enigmatic strength"

7. **Clothing & Context**:
   - Default: "Relaxed and casual‚Äîflannel shirts, jeans, shorts, leather jacket, or henley, slightly rugged, bear costume headpiece integrated naturally"
   - Optional variations: "Loose muscle shirt (open-collared shirt, blazer)" or "Relaxed outdoor gear (parka, scarf)" to suggest importance in different settings also "revealing clothing (shirtless, muscle shirts, shorts, leather vests, tight jeans, chest harness etc.) to show some skin and sexiness."

8. **Art Style & Technical Details**:
   - "Hyper photo-realistic rendering, photograph, natural lighting, shallow depth of field, medium shot, cinematic composition, vivid colors."

#### Usage Instructions:
- Specify sunglasses type (e.g., "pink mirrored aviators") or shadow style (e.g., "harsh side lighting") for variation.
- The bear headpiece should always frame the face, never cover it‚Äîthink mascot-style but sleek and integrated.
